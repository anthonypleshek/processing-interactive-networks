Sketch for creating interactive networks/graphs using [Processing](http://processing.org) written during a hackathon, so the code is an absolute mess right now.

The data is structured in such a way where each node/vertex in the network/graph has start and end points. A few network configurations are included, as well as two types of interaction with a Kinect, and an example which just uses noise() to simulate interaction.

*TODO:*
- Clean up code; probably split things apart and make it more sensible to switch between different types of network configurations and interaction types.
- Add interaction types: audio, basic motion detection with camera instead of Kinect, etc.
- Fix Kinect interaction to work with users further away.
